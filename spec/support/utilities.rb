include ApplicationHelper

# The following code is uncommented and replaced with 'include ApplicatonHelper'  referencing the file # under the folder 'helpers'. Flesh out the reasoning for this with some documentation.

# def full_title(page_title)
#   base_title = "RonR Sample App"
#   if page_title.empty?
#     base_title
#   else
#     "#{base_title} | #{page_title}"
#   end
# end
